# Kickstart ELK
The ultimate aim of this ELK (Elastic) starter-kit Git repository is to help you collect log, metric and performance data of sample CRM app running on Docker containers. We use Beats framework to collect and push the data to Logstash, whereas Logstash parses the data and index it to Elasticsearch for building visualizations and dashboards on Kibana user interface. You need user manual to operate the starter-kit. Contact us to get the user manual and start learning ELK (Elastic) today.
